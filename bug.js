In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can stem from incorrect usage of the `useEffect` hook, specifically when dealing with asynchronous operations and cleanup functions.  Consider this scenario: 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('some-api-endpoint');
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
  };

  fetchData();
}, []);
```

This code fetches data on mount. However, if the component unmounts before `fetchData` completes, it might cause errors or unexpected behavior. The problem is that `setData` will still try to update the state of an unmounted component, leading to warnings or crashes.
